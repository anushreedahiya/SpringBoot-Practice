## Spring Boot 
Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring Framework that makes it easy, fast, and efficient to build Java-based backend applications, especially RESTful web services and microservices.
That is Spring Boot removes complexity from Spring and lets you focus on writing business logic instead of configuration.

This repository is a curated collection of independent Spring Boot practice projects, where each project focuses on a specific Spring / backend concept.
Instead of one large application, this repo is organized as concept-driven modules to build a strong foundation in Spring Boot and backend engineering.

#### 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
-Practice Spring Boot topic by topic
-Build concept clarity instead of monolithic apps
-Maintain small, focused, testable projects
-Use as a revision + interview prep resource
